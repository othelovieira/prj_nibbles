# Project Nibbles

This is the original Microsoft QBasic Nibbles code. (Microsoft DOS 6.22)

 Nibbles is a game for one or two players.  Navigate your snakes
around the game board trying to eat up numbers while avoiding
running into walls or other snakes.  The more numbers you eat up,
the more points you gain and the longer your snake becomes.
